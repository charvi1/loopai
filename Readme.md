# Ingestion API

## Description

A rate-limited, priority-aware asynchronous ingestion API built with Express.

## Why Express and Node.js?
Fast & Non-blocking I/O: Node.js is well-suited for asynchronous tasks like batch processing and time-based job scheduling.

 Lightweight and Minimal: Express provides a minimalist web framework that makes it easy to define REST APIs quickly.

Asynchronous Architecture: Using native JavaScript Promises, setInterval, and setTimeout, we were able to build a fully asynchronous worker that respects timing constraints without relying on external job queues.

 In-memory Storage: Nodeâ€™s persistent memory space during runtime allowed for a simple yet effective in-memory store (store.js) to track ingestion and batch status without a database.
